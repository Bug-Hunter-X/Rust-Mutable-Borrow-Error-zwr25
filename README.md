# Rust Mutable Borrow Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: attempting to have both a mutable and immutable borrow of the same variable at the same time.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which will result in a compiler error. The `bugSolution.rs` file presents a corrected version.

## Error Explanation

Rust's ownership and borrowing system prevents data races and other concurrency issues.  It's designed to ensure that only one mutable reference to a given piece of data exists at any time.  Trying to violate this rule leads to a compiler error, preventing potentially dangerous behavior.

## How to fix

The fix usually involves restructuring the code to avoid simultaneous mutable and immutable borrows, often by reordering operations or creating copies of the data as needed.  See `bugSolution.rs` for a possible solution.
